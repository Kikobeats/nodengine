When you run the command, automagically it switches your node runtime
based in the `engines.node` field declared at `package.json`
of the project.

If the `package.json` or `engines.node` doesn't exists, nothing happens.

Usage
  $ nodengine

Flags
  NODENGINE_INTERVAL
    Local cache for keep a list of all node versions to be resolved.

    The list, by default, is fetched after 5 days.

    You can setup a custom intervaling passing a milliseconds number.
    For example, if you want to force download the list of all node
    versions just pass a 0:

    NODENGINE_INTERVAL=0 nodengine

Examples
  $ nodengine
  $ NODENGINE_INTERVAL=0 nodengine
